**FORKED** from https://github.com/padhi-homelab/docker_tang
I have removed the Volume configuration and added a small script to allow the tang crypto data to be fed in via a docker secret as a tar file or as a clevis encrypted blob containing the tar file. The idea is to never store the tang crypto on a native filesystem, but to have a mesh of dockerised tang servers seed each other.

A multiarch [tang] Docker image, based on [Alpine Linux].

## Usage

```
docker run -p 1234:8080 -it padhihomelab/tang
```

Runs `tang` server on port `1234`.

You might also want to use:
- the `--detach` to run the container in background
- the `--rm` to cleanup the container filesystem after `docker` exits
- a `docker compose` workflow instead (see: [services/tang])

## IPv4 vs IPv6

By default, the `tang` server only listens on IPv4.
You may, however, also listen on IPv6 by creating a container
with `ENABLE_IPv6=1` set:

```
docker run -e ENABLE_IPv6=1 ...
```

You may even disable listening on IPv4 entirely,
and only listen on IPv6 instead:

```
docker run -e ENABLE_IPv4=0 -e ENABLE_IPv6=1 ...
```

## Persistent Database

To persist tang's database beyond the lifetime of a container,
you could bind mount a host filesystem directory at `/db`:

```
docker run -v /path/to/tang/db:/db \
           -p 1234:8080 \
           -it padhihomelab/tang
```

This container drops `root` privilege at startup,
and runs `tang` as an unprivileged user with `DOCKER_UID` id.
So, the files in `/path/to/tang/db` that are written by `tang`
are owned by the `$DOCKER_UID` user id within the container.  
For your host system user to be able to access them,
you may override the `DOCKER_UID` variable when starting the container:

```
docker run -v /path/to/tang/db:/db \
           -e DOCKER_UID=$(id -u) \
           -p 1234:8080 \
           -it padhihomelab/tang
```
